    <h3>Ram Janmabhoomi :- </h3>
    <p>In 1853, a group of armed Hindu ascetics belonging to the Nirmohi Akhara occupied the Babri Masjid site, and claimed ownership of the structure.[28] Subsequently, the civil administration stepped in, and in 1855, divided the mosque premises into two parts: one for Hindus, and the other for Muslims.[29]

        In 1883, the Hindus launched an effort to construct a temple on the platform. When the administration denied them the permission to do this, they took the matter to court. In 1885, the Hindu Sub Judge Pandit Hari Kishan Singh dismissed the lawsuit. Subsequently, the higher courts also dismissed the lawsuit in 1886, in favour of status quo. In December 1949, some Hindus placed idols of Rama and Sita in the mosque, and claimed that they had miraculously appeared there. Home Minister Vallabhbhai Patel and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru directed the state's Chief Minister Govind Ballabh Pant to remove the idols, however Pant was not willing to remove the idols and added that "there is a reasonable chance of success, but things are still in a fluid state and it will be hazardous to say more at this stage".[30][31] By 1950, the state took control of the structure under section 145 CrPC and allowed Hindus, not Muslims, to perform their worship at the site.[32]
        
        In the 1980s, the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) and other Hindu nationalist groups and political parties launched a campaign to construct the Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir ("Rama birthplace temple") at the site. In 1985, the Rajiv Gandhi government allowed Hindus to access the site for prayers.[33] On 6 December 1992, Hindu nationalists demolished the mosque, resulting in communal riots leading to over 2,000 deaths.[34]
        
        In 2010, the Allahabad High Court ruled that the 2.77 acres (1.12 ha) of disputed land be divided into 3 parts, with 1⁄3 going to the Ram Lalla or Infant Lord Rama represented by the Hindu Mahasabha for the construction of the Ram temple, 1⁄3 going to the Muslim Sunni Waqf Board and the remaining 1⁄3 going to a Hindu religious denomination Nirmohi Akhara.[43] All the three parties appealed against the division of disputed land to the Supreme Court.[44][45]
        <h3>Deity :-</h3>
        <img  height="250"width="150" src="God Shreem ram.jpg">
        <p>Ram Lalla Virajman, the infant form of Rama, an avatar of Vishnu, is the presiding deity of the temple.[68] Ram Lalla's dress was stitched by tailors Bhagwat Prasad and Shankar Lal, a fourth generation tailor to Rama's idol.[69] Ram Lalla was a litigant in the court case over the disputed site in 1989, being considered a "juristic person" by the law.[2] He was represented by Triloki Nath Pandey, a senior VHP leader who was considered Ram Lalla's closest 'human' friend.[68] According to the temple trust, the final blueprint included temples dedicated to Surya, Ganesha, Shiva, Durga, Vishnu and Brahma in the temple grounds.[70] Two idols of Ram Lalla (one of them being 5 years old) is consecrated in the sanctum of the temple.[61]

            On 29 December 2023, the selection of the idol of Ram Lalla for the Ram Mandir was done through a voting process. A sculptor, known for various statues across India created by him, Arun Yogiraj, from Mysore, Karnataka, created the idol of Rama.[71][72][73]</p>
        <h3>About This Rama Temple :-</h3>
        <p>The temple has been built on one of India's most controversial sites, replacing the Babri Masjid, a 16th-century mosque that was demolished by Hindu zealots in 1992 who believed it stood on the site of another Hindu temple. The events sparked nationwide communal riots that killed thousands of people.3 days ago</p>
        <h3>Bhumi Pujan ceremony :-</h3>
        <img height="300" width="500" src="Bhoomi Puja.jpg" >
        <p>The temple construction officially started again after a Bhumi-Pujan (transl. ground breaking ceremony) on 5 August 2020. The three-day long Vedic ritual was held ahead of the groundbreaking ceremony, which revolved around the installation of a 40 kg (88 pounds) silver brick as the foundation stone by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.[2] On the day before on 4 August, the Ramarchan Puja (transl. Puja of Rama's feet) was performed, in order to ritually invite all the major deities into the temple.[81]

            On the occasion of the Bhoomi Poojan, soil and holy water were collected from several religious places across India, such as the Triveni Sangam of the rivers Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati at Prayagraj, as well as the Kaveri river from its orgin at Talakaveri in Karnataka and the Kamakhya Temple in Assam.[82][83][84] Soil was also sent from various Hindu temples, gurudwaras and Jain temples across the nation, as well as from the four pilgrimage locations of Char Dham, to bless the temple.[85][86][87]
            
            On 5 August, Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered prayers at the Hanuman Garhi Temple in Ayodhya to seek blessings of Hanuman for the day's events.[88][89] The groundbreaking ceremony of Ram Mandir took place following this.[88] The Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath, Chief of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Mohan Bhagwat, Chief of the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas and Chief of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra, Nritya Gopal Das and Narendra Modi gave speeches.[88][90][91]</p>
        <h3>Consecration :-</h3>
        <img height="300" src="consecration.jpg">
        <p>In preparation for the Prana Pratishtha (consecration) ceremony, the Government of Uttar Pradesh earmarked ₹100 crore (US$13 million) for 'Ramotsav,' a series of religious events that spanned 826 local bodies across Uttar Pradesh along with the Ram Paduka Yatra. The events commenced from December 2023, culminated in the grand celebrations from Makar Sankranti on 16 January 2024, and lasted until the inauguration of the Ram Mandir on 22 January. The yatra followed the Ram Van Gaman Path, retracing Rama's 14-year exile from Ayodhya.[107] Prime Minister Narendra Modi along with RSS Sarsanghchalak, Mohan Bhagwat, Congress leaders and leaders from other opposition political parties were invited for attending the consecration ceremony.[108][109] The guest list also included prominent industrialists, scientists, actors, army officers, spiritual leaders and Padma awardees.[110][111]</p>
